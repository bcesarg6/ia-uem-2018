Saahil Shenoy (SMâ14) is working toward the
Ph.D. degree in physics at Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA, where he is an ARCS Foundation
Scholar. He completed the MS requirements in Particle Physics at the age of 20. His Stanford research
is in big data analytics for extreme events, with applications in energy, finance, climate change, cloud
computing, and risk analysis. He worked on portfolio
optimization with Charles Schwab. He was the Best
Student Paper Award Finalist at the 2015 American
Control Conference and authored several papers in
IEEE journals and conferences.
Dimitry Gorinevsky (Mâ91âSMâ98âFâ06) received
