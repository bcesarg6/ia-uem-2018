Anton Tenyakov received the B.Sc. degree in applied
mathematics (first class with distinction) and the
M.A. degree in statistics (with concentration in
Financial Mathematics) both from York University,
Toronto, ON, Canada, and the Ph.D. degree from the
University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.
He is a Manager, Financial Modeling in the Treasury
and Balance Sheet Management Department, TD
Bank Group, Toronto, ON, Canada. His research
interests include the applications of HMM filtering
methods in the parameter estimation of new and
extended regime-switching-based models for various financial markets.
Rogemar Mamon (Mâ16) is a Professor with the
Department of Statistical and Actuarial Sciences,
University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.
His research interests include the applications of
stochastic processes to financial and actuarial modeling, hidden Markov models and their estimation
including filtering, smoothing and prediction, and
inverse problems in finance. He is a Co-Editor of the
IMA Journal of Management Mathematics (Oxford
University Press). He is an elected Fellow of the
U.K.âs Institute of Mathematics and its Applications
and Chartered Scientist of the U.K.âs Science Council.
Matt Davison received the degrees in engineering and maths. He was previously a Front Office
Desk Quant with Deutsche Bank Canada. He is
a Professor with the Department of Statistical
and Actuarial Sciences and the Department of
Applied Mathematics, University of Western Ontario,
London, ON, Canada. He has held the Canada
Research Chair in Quantitative Finance and is a
Fellow of the Fields Institute for Research in
Mathematical Sciences, Toronto, ON, Canada. His
research interests include computational finance,
incomplete market theory, and energy finance. He continues to consult with
industry and serves as the Director and an Advisor to several Toronto-area
financial companies.
