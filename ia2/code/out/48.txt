Danny Crookes became a Professor of computer
engineering in 1993 at Queens University Belfast
(QUB), Belfast, U.K., and was the Head of Computer Science from 1993 to 2002. He is the Director
of Research for Speech, Image and Vision Systems
at the Institute for Electronics, Communications and
Information Technology, QUB. His current research
interests include the use of novel architectures (especially GPUs) for high-performance image and speech
processing. He is currently involved in projects in acceleration of financial simulations, speech enhancement, face recognition, and image processing for cancer diagnosis. He has
published more than 230 scientific papers in journals and international conferences, and has presented tutorials on parallel image processing at several
international conferences.

Sean Trainor received the M.Sc. degree in
pure mathematics from Queenâs University Belfast
(QUB), Belfast, U.K., in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree
in financial simulation from the Institute for Electronics, Communications and Information Technology,
QUB, in 2015. He has worked in developing financial products in several financial markets companies
in the City of London.

Richard Jiang received the Ph.D. degree in computer
science from Queenâs University Belfast, Belfast,
U.K., in 2008.
After the Ph.D. study, he was with Brunel University, Loughborough University, Swansea University, the University of Bath, and the University of
Sheffield. He joined Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K., in May 2013, where he is
currently a Lecturer in the Department of Computer
Science and Digital Technologies. His research interests mainly reside in the fields of artificial intelligence, manâmachine interaction, hardware acceleration, visual forensics, and
biomedical image analysis. His research has been funded by EPSRC, BBSRC,
TSB, EU FP, and industry, and he has authored some 50 publications.
